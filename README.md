Leap In!- Predictive Modeling 





IT Industry Project is a part of Data Science units where we work for our University's Industry Partner. The industry partner in this case is Leap In!. Leap In! provided their data which is not included due to the privacy and confidentiality purpose.  ***The files/codes are highly documented to give clear understanding of code as well as the concept of what is being done in the file.*** ***The Project Description and Deliverable are as follows.***

**Project Description:** One of the key goals for Leap in! is to support our members to fully utilise their NDIS budgets.  The average NDIS participant receives $52,000 in supports budget annually, but only spend 68%.  Members may not fully utilise their budgets for a range of reasons.  For example, because they don't know how to, because they can't find supports that are available in their area, because it takes them too long to secure supports, because they aren't happy with the supports provided in their area or because there are no appropriate supports delivered in their area. 
Leap in! processes over 30,000 invoices per month, from thousands of providers for hundreds of different kinds of services each month, on behalf of our 5000+ members.  
This project would look to mine our claims and other relevant data to look for patterns in the data linking utilisation of member budgets to other attributes (e.g. location, life stage, nature of disability, available funds, category of spend etc), to identify the profile of members who may need more intervention early in their plans to connect them with available supports, etc. 

**Project Deliverables:** The project team will develop models to identify people who are likely to over- or under-spend during their current plan.  They will assess potentially influential factors including geographical location, demographics, provider profile, service profile, budget profile, age, gender and disability.
They will generate a report detailing the impact of each of these factors on spend behaviour as well as developing a predictive model to be used to identify individuals in real time so our team can proactively assist the members to better manage their available funding.
**The folder "Leap-in-Artefact"** consists of 2 Jupyter Notebooks. 

 1. ***leap_in_df_with_40pc:*** It is a final dataframe obtained after merging, filtering using business logic and critical analysis of  6 separate datasets provided by Leap In!. This is the file used for Exploratory Data Analysis **(EDA)** using **Tableau** software. This is also the file used to create the final Model in predicting users spending behaviors. 
 
 2. ***Leap In Model:*** This is the file where predictive Model with 99.23% accuracy prepared. It is highly documented to make reader understand what is being done at each and every steps.
